## Three topics but the same goal

In a project you will always have to work on these three different topics:
* Task estimation
* Coding standards
* Code reviews

These are basic notions in the world of tek but very often misused or misunderstood.<br>
If you are fully aware of these three categories your work and the one of your colleagues will be much easier.<br>

Let's take an example, if you have the necessary knowledge on expected code quality with test writing, code review, code architecture and implementation you will be able to provide more concrete and viable estimates. <br>

Knowing how to master these three topics also allows you to accentuate your team performance by working on the same coding standards, providing excellent code reviews and estimating your tasks in an intelligent way.<br>

Finally, a good execution of these three topics will also allow you to improve the quality of the project's code and therefore considerably reduce the risk of bugs in your code.
