## Code documentation

Writing code documentation is not an easy task but it is very important.
Whether it is for other developers who will use your code or even for you later when you have to proofread it.

Each part of a project documentation is important and has its role.

* The short description allows the person who will read your code to know right away what it is used for.

* The Getting Started Guide should be accompanied by a basic example to show how your code works

* Tutorials should show examples of code with comments on the most likely use cases of the code

* The example projects show how an entire project using your code can work.

* The API documentation is the densest part to do but the most useful for other developers.
Every function, class, variable that can be used must be documented.
    
    Each element should be explained with a short description and if possible accompanied by a practical example

* The Architecture section is not as important as the previous sections but it is useful for people who could contribute to the project.
