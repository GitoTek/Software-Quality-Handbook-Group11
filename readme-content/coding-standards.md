## Different code norms

The coding rules are decided according to the needs of the company and the languages.

### The goal

Having rules to code allows to have a uniform code for all developers.
This makes it easier to read during reviews and increases maintainability.
Code can be more easily reused and errors much more easily detected.
Finally, the efficiency of the team is improved.

### The rules

Below is a non-exhaustive list of the most commonly used rules

1. Naming conventions for variables and function

    * Have meaningful variable names.
    * Avoid numbers in variable names
    * Have explicit function names with a verb

2. Identation

    Indentation concerns the number of spaces (or tabs) in a function or an if, while statement and even the spaces to put between 2 arguments of a function.
    
    For example, the braces that can be on a new line and the block of code that follows that must be on a new line too
3. Length of function

    Having short functions makes the program more structured and easier to read.
    Short functions with explicit names make debugging and code review much faster
4. Not use the GOTO keyword
    
    This keyword makes the program difficult to understand and follow. Debugging becomes much more complicated
