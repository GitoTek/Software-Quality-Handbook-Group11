## How to do a good review

Code reviews are made to have a better code
And doing better code reviews makes for even better code!
Let's see how to make code reviews more efficient

### How to prepare the review

1. The important questions to have in mind
    * Do I understand what the code does?
    * Does the code function as I expect it to?
    * Does this code fulfill regulatory requirements?

2. What to look in the code
    * Structure
    * Style
    * Logic
    * Performance
    * Test coverage
    * Design
    * Readability
    * Functionality

### Best practice for a good review

1. Build & Run the program
    * You can see how the program works
    * This allows you to ensure that the code works as intended

2. Don't review for more than 60 minutes
    * After this time, your concentration will no longer be maximal
    * Taking breaks allows you to return to the review with a clearer mind

3. Check no more than 400 lines at a time
    * After this limit, it will be more complicated to find errors

4. Give feedbacks
    * Don't be insulting or judgmental !
    * Be constructive by asking question
    * Honored the good things in the code
