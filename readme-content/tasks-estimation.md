## What are estimation criterias? Which bad habits?

In order to correctly estimate a task it is essential to have the following criteria that will define the complexity of the work:
- Work complexity
- The amount of work
- Risk or uncertainty

These three factors are the key elements to keep in mind when estimating. Errors in relative estimation are not without error. Here are 3 examples of errors not to be reproduced
1. Measuring Productivity by Points
    * When we estimate tasks with points it is abstract. Each team has a different vision than the other. It is therefore important not to compare the productivity of a team based on the number of story points completed in a sprint.
2. Equating Points With Hours or Days
    * For teams starting out in agility, the most common mistake is to simplify the number of points to a number of hours spent in development. It is important to understand that there is no formula for converting points to development hours.
3. Failing to Learn
    * When we talk about agility, it necessarily includes the notion of learning. It is essential to be able to learn from past mistakes and successes in order to correct them or continue them.
