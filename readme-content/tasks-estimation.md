## How to realize a sprint planning?

The sprint planning is the ceremony in scrum to estimate and define the tasks that will be addressed during the next sprint.<br>
In order for this event to take place in the best conditions it is necessary to have a detailed backlog.<br>
The team members then estimate each task to be performed. It is possible that some team members do not agree with the estimate. There should be a short time to discuss this difference. If the team does not agree on the estimate of a task, the highest estimate will prevail. <br>

To finish in SCRUM we focus on the elements that add the most value to the product. It is therefore logical to estimate and put in the backlog of the next sprint the tasks that have the greatest added value.
