## Introduction

Task estimation is at the very root of project planning. In an agile world how are we supposed to estimate our tasks.

## Absolute vs relative estimation

There are two types of estimation, the most known and unfortunately still the most used is the absolute estimation. It simply consists in estimating a task in terms of hours of development required. <br>

As you can see from the illustration it is almost impossible to estimate a task accurately. One of the biggest issue of absolute estimation is dates have an emotional attachment to them. Relative estimation removes the emotional attachment. <br>
<br>
To counter this problem in agile we use relative estimation, which means giving a weight to a task without providing a precise estimate.
