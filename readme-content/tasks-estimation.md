## Introduction

Task estimation is at the very root of project planning. In an agile world how are we supposed to estimate our tasks.

## Absolute vs relative estimation

There are two types of estimation, the most known and unfortunately still the most used is the absolute estimation. It simply consists in estimating a task in terms of hours of development required. <br>

As you can see from the illustration it is almost impossible to estimate a task accurately. One of the biggest issue of absolute estimation is dates have an emotional attachment to them. Relative estimation removes the emotional attachment. <br>
<br>
To counter this problem in agile we use relative estimation, which means giving a weight to a task without providing a precise estimate.

## The different estimation methods - Why do we prefer Fibonacci ?

<br>There are different estimation methods that can be userd for software projects. Here is a list of the ones we prefer:<br>

### The Bucket System Estimation

This method is pretty simple. Each member of the team discuss a number to assign to a task and place it under a "bucket".<br>
It is a nice method for quick estimations for a large number of items.

### Three-Point Method

With this method, we define the optimistic (O), pessimist (P) and most likely (ML) effort value to then calculate the average time using a formula.<br>
It is a nice method for teams new to agile.<br>
There are two different formulas:<br>

### Planning Poker with the Fibonacci sequence

For this method, each team member has cards with numbers from the result of a sequence of the summ of the previous two numbers.<br>
Each team member selects secretly a card and all cards are revealed at the same time.<br>
The card with the most voting is the finalized estimate. If the team can't agree, a meeting is done before a new vote.<br>
If the selected card ha a too high number the task will be splitted in different tasks for which there will be a vote.<br>

This method is the method we prefer because it is dynamic, it enables to have good estimates, split the too complicated tasks and moreover, everyone is concerned by each tasks.<br>
